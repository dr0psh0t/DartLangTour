Dart libraries are full of functions that return Future or Stream objects.
These functions are asynchronous: they return after setting up a possibly
time-consuming operation (such as I/O), without waiting for that operation to complete.

The async and await keywords support asynchronous programming, letting you
write asynchronous code that looks similar to synchronous code.
