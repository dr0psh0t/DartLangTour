Use metadata to give additional information about your code. A metadata annotation begins with the
character @, followed by either a reference to a compile-time constant (such as deprecated) or a
call to a constant constructor.

Three annotations are available to all Dart code: @Deprecated, @deprecated, and @override.
For examples of using @override, see Extending a class.
