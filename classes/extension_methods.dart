/*
Extension methods are a way to add functionality to existing libraries. You
might use extension methods without even knowing it. For example, when you use
code completion in an IDE, it suggests extension methods alongside regular
methods.

Here’s an example of using an extension method on String named parseInt()
that’s defined in string_apis.dart:
 */

/*

import 'package:strings_apis.dart';

void main() {
  print('42'.padLeft(5)); // Use a String method.
  print('42'.parseInt()); // Use an extension method.
}
